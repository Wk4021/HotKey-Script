# HotKey Script
 The Hotkey Script Playground is a Python-based automation tool designed to create, manage, and execute custom hotkey scripts using a visual drag-and-drop interface. Users can design automation workflows by placing blocks, such as keyboard actions, mouse clicks, wait timers, and coordinate finders, onto a canvas and connecting them to define execution order. Each block represents a specific action that can be customized, allowing for flexible, user-defined workflows.  The project features a clean and intuitive UI, built using Tkinter, where users can easily drag and drop functional blocks to create their automation sequences. Users can save, load, and delete different automation scripts for reuse. The scripts are managed through a backend system that handles script storage, hotkey assignments, and execution flow.  This project aims to simplify repetitive tasks by providing an easy-to-use interface for creating powerful hotkey-based automations without requiring extensive programming knowledge.
